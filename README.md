# Dashboard App
A Dashboard App where users can create an account (with their credentials or using an OAuth provider), create customers and assign invoices to them. Invoices will be shown at the Dashboard page as a summary. This project is based on the Next Learn Course, the official Next.js 14 tutorial and created by Vercel.

## This project is a Dashboard App that is a single page application (SPA) with client-side navigation and three main pages:
- Dashboard - A summary of all invoices.
- Invoices - A list of all invoices and the possibility of searching, creating, editing or deleting any invoice. It also has pagination at the bottom of the page.
- Customers - A list of all customers with a search bar for searching for specific customers. There's no pagination here in this version, so all customers are displayed at the same time.
- Dark Theme - Based on Tailwind.css and that only works based on the browser theme.

## Here’s everything I did in the version 2.0:
- Multiuser system
- OAuth Authentication
- Pagination for the customers, as they're going to be flexible at this version
- Dark Theme feature based on the user's browser theme
